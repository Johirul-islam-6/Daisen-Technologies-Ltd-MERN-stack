# Project Title

This is a simple React project with a structured component-based architecture. The project includes routing, layout components, and reusable UI elements.

## Project Structure

The folder structure is organized as follows:

\`\`\`
src/
├── assets/ # Contains assets like images, icons, etc.
├── Components/ # Contains reusable components
│ ├── Home/ # Components related to Home page
│ └── Navbar/ # Navbar component for site navigation
├── Layout/ # Contains layout components
│ └── MainLayout/ # Main layout of the application
├── Pages/ # Pages for different routes
│ └── Home/ # Home page
├── router/ # Contains the routing logic
│ └── Router.jsx # Main routing configuration
├── index.css # Global styles
├── main.jsx # Entry point for the React application
\`\`\`

## Layout Design

- **MainLayout.jsx**: This file is responsible for rendering the main layout of the application, including the Navbar and other page components.
- **Navbar.jsx**: A reusable component for site-wide navigation, included in the main layout.
- **Pages**: Pages folder contains different route components, such as Home and About, which are linked via \`react-router-dom\`.

The application follows a clean layout design where each page is wrapped by a consistent navbar, and the main layout is responsible for switching between different page components based on the current route.
